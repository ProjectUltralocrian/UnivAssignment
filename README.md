# UnivAssignment
Practice project, building a simple command line app with a hashtable-like structure. It largely follows the university assignment featured in a C++ tutorial by Cherno on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQsHF7C-FUY&t=2663s), with minor modifications and written in Haskell.
